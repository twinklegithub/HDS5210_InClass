Tools for analysing human activity data together with textual findings can be used in the given project to identify movement pathologies, assess the patient’s rehabilitation process, and propose an individual exercise regimen. Products that are wearable will also be able to incorporate this analysis and give users timely feedback to help in implementing normal interferences to users’ experience. It is rather interesting to see how this project connects HAR with AI and opens a new set of uses for wearable technology. It lays the potential to bring change to health results, safety at workplace, and make personal contact with clients more effective, which qualifies it for enhancing human-centric solutions.\n",

Such cases, organizations are able to determine important variables that would affect the ability of employees to be retained or strategies that could be used to create effective work environments especially when implementing change such as low turnover or improved team results. This project is interesting because it focus on an important aspect of organisations today: the management of the workforce with the help of big data and analytical tools. Drawing analytical conclusions and following the trends in employees requirements business can create effective and pleasant working climate which increases the satisfaction and performance rate.\n"
